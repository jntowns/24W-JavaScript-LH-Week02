    /* STEP 1: Number types (integer, float, and double)
    declare and initialize an integer and a float, then in the console, reveal the number type with typeof(varName) */

    var num2 = 19.65;
    console.log(num1 + " - " + typeof(num1));
    console.log(num2 + " - " + typeof(num2));
    // Note - there are also different number systems: binary, octal, and hexadecimal

    /* STEP 2: Arithmetic operators
    + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (remainder or modulo) */
    console.log("num1 + num2 = " + (num1 + num2));

    /* Keep in mind operator precedence, just like you were taught in math class (*, /, +, -)
    num1 + num2 * 5 - 25 ... is not 575 ... it is 215 */

    /* If you want to avoid this precedence, use parenthesis
    (num1 + num2) * 5 - 25 */

    /* STEP 3: Increment and decrement operators
    ++ and -- are mostly found inside loops to move a counter variable to the next value when needed, either up or down. */

    console.log(num1);
    num2--;
    console.log(num2);
    // Note 1 - you cannot increment/decrement a number directly
    // Note 2 - typing num++ or num-- in the console will output the number before incrementing or decrmenting - try ++num or --num, instead

    /* STEP 4: Assignment Operators
    = (assignment), += (addition assignment), -= (subtraction assignment), *= (multiplication assignment), /= (division assignment) */
    num1*=8;

    ===	(strict equality), !==	(strict-non-equality), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >=	(greater than or equal to) */
